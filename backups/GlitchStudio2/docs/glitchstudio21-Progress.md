# GlitchStudio2.1 - Progress Report

This document tracks the progress made on the GlitchStudio2.1 enhancement plan (as outlined in `glitchstudio21-plan.md`) and details the remaining steps.

## Phase 1: Fix Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

### Completed in Phase 1:

1. **Simplified Effect Structure** ✅
   - Created new, cleaner effect object pattern with clear parameter definitions
   - Each effect now has `name`, `displayName`, `category`, `params`, and `process` function
   - Parameters include UI metadata (min, max, step, options, displayName, tooltip)
   - Example: See `js/effects/color/hue-shift.js`

2. **Fixed Control Generation** ✅
   - Created new `js/ui/effect-controls.js` module that properly generates UI controls
   - Supports sliders, dropdowns, and toggles based on parameter definitions
   - Uses custom events (`effectParameterChange`) for clean parameter updates
   - Removed dependency on complex control factory

3. **Updated Registry System** ✅
   - Simplified `js/core/registry.js` to work with new effect structure
   - Uses Map for better performance
   - Cleaner enable/disable/toggle methods
   - Effects now stored with their full parameter objects

4. **Fixed Processing Pipeline** ✅
   - Effects now modify ImageData in-place for better performance
   - Updated `processEffectChain` to pass parameters correctly
   - Canvas properly updates after effect processing

5. **Updated UI Manager** ✅
   - Rewritten `js/ui/ui-manager.js` to work with new effect system
   - Properly handles effect toggling and parameter updates
   - Fixed file upload handlers
   - Clean separation between UI and effect logic

6. **Converted Existing Effects** ✅
   - All color effects converted to new structure:
     - `hue-shift.js` - Full parameter controls
     - `invert.js` - Simple effect with no parameters
     - `posterize.js` - Slider control for levels
     - `threshold.js` - Slider control for threshold
   - Updated `pixel-sort.js` to new structure with dropdown controls

7. **Created Test Environment** ✅
   - Created `test.html` for testing the updated system
   - Minimal HTML structure focusing on core functionality

### Issues Fixed from Original Plan:

- ✅ **Control generation not working properly** - Now uses simplified system
- ✅ **Effects not processing ImageData correctly** - Now modify in-place
- ✅ **Over-complicated registry system** - Simplified with Map-based approach
- ✅ **Broken connections between UI and effect processing** - Fixed with event system

## Phase 2: Port Missing Effects (NOT STARTED)

### Effects to Port from newstudio:

1. **Glitch Effects:**
   - [ ] Spiral (with CW/CCW/inside-out/outside-in) - placeholder created
   - [ ] Direction Shift (with clumps system) - placeholder created
   - [ ] Slice (horizontal/vertical/both with color offset) - placeholder created
   - [ ] Enhanced Pixel Sort (7 variations including diagonal, circular)

2. **Color Effects:**
   - [ ] Chromatic Aberration
   - [ ] RGB Separation
   - [ ] Saturation
   - [ ] Vintage

3. **Experimental Effects:**
   - [ ] Datamosh (4 variations: randomBytes, bitShift, compression, scanlines)
   - [ ] Audio Reactive system

### Effects to Port from WIP Glitcher 2:

1. **Filter Effects:**
   - [ ] Edge Detection
   - [ ] Motion Blur (with direction options)

2. **Artistic Effects:**
   - [ ] Emboss (currently in experimental, should move to artistic)

3. **Distortion Effects:**
   - [ ] Advanced Glitch (random block corruption)

## Phase 3: Add Advanced Features (NOT STARTED)

### Features to Implement:

1. **Audio Reactivity Module**
   - [ ] Microphone input capture
   - [ ] Audio level analysis
   - [ ] Integration with effect parameters

2. **Batch Export Module**
   - [ ] Multiple variation generation
   - [ ] Randomized parameter sets
   - [ ] Bulk file saving

3. **Recording Module**
   - [ ] WebM/MP4 recording
   - [ ] Configurable duration
   - [ ] Frame rate control

## Current State Summary

### What's Working:
- ✅ Basic app structure and initialization
- ✅ Image loading and canvas display
- ✅ Effect registration system
- ✅ UI control generation
- ✅ Parameter updates
- ✅ Color effects (4 working effects)
- ✅ Basic pixel sort effect
- ✅ Effect toggling and chaining
- ✅ Global intensity control

### What's Not Implemented:
- ❌ Most glitch effects (only pixel sort works)
- ❌ All artistic effects
- ❌ All distortion effects
- ❌ All filter effects
- ❌ All experimental effects
- ❌ Audio reactive features
- ❌ Batch export
- ❌ Recording capabilities
- ❌ Presets system integration with new structure

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority:** Implement the core glitch effects from newstudio
   - Start with Spiral effect (most visual impact)
   - Then Direction Shift (unique clumps system)
   - Then Slice effect

2. **Secondary Priority:** Port color and experimental effects
   - Chromatic Aberration and RGB Separation
   - Datamosh effects

3. **Final Priority:** Advanced features
   - Audio reactivity
   - Batch export
   - Recording

## File Structure Changes

### New/Modified Files in Phase 1:
- `js/core/registry.js` - Completely rewritten
- `js/ui/effect-controls.js` - New file
- `js/ui/ui-manager.js` - Significantly updated
- `js/core/app.js` - Updated to use new system
- `js/effects/index.js` - New central export
- `js/effects/color/*.js` - All updated to new structure
- `js/effects/glitch/pixel-sort.js` - Updated to new structure
- `test.html` - New test file

### Placeholder Files Created:
- `js/effects/glitch/direction-shift.js`
- `js/effects/glitch/slice.js`
- `js/effects/glitch/spiral.js`
- `js/effects/*/index.js` - Category exports

This progress report accurately reflects the current state as of the completion of Phase 1.
